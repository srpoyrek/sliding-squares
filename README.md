# Optimal Sliding Squares

Two n×n square robots swap positions in a grid workspace.
Find the workspace that maximizes the minimum number of control switches.

## Problem

Given a grid workspace with obstacles, two identical n×n square robots (A and B) must exchange positions. Only one robot is "controlled" at a time — issuing a control switch command transfers control to the other robot. The solver finds the path that minimizes the number of control switches needed to complete the swap.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pre_commit install
```

Requires Python 3.8+.

The `pre-commit` hooks run on every commit:

- **ruff** — auto-format and lint Python code
- **graphify-build** — rebuild the code knowledge graph (only when `.py` files are staged) and re-stage the regenerated `graphify-out/` artifacts so the graph stays in sync with the code

To skip the graph rebuild on a single commit (rare): `SKIP=graphify-build git commit -m "..."`.

## Algorithm

The solver runs a **bidirectional layered breadth-first search** over the state space `(pos_a, pos_b, control)` — see [`src/solver.py`](src/solver.py) and [`src/bfs.py`](src/bfs.py):

1. **Layered structure.** Each BFS layer represents states reachable with exactly *k* control switches. Within a layer, `flood_fill` explores all positions the controlled robot can reach without switching.
2. **Bidirectional expansion.** A forward BFS from the start and a backward BFS from the goal are expanded in lockstep. Both initial controllers are seeded in forward layer 0 and both final controllers in backward layer 0, so the run finds the minimum-switch solution over any choice of first/last mover in a single pass.
3. **Symmetry pruning.** [`src/canonical.py`](src/canonical.py) detects when a workspace is invariant under an A↔B label swap; in that case the dual-start expansion is collapsed to a single BFS half, halving the work.
4. **Memoization.** Per-process LRU caches in `bfs.py` (`_USABLE_CACHE`, `_PARENT_MAP_CACHE`, `_VALID_POS_CACHE`) memoize flood-fill results and valid-position sets. Keys include a `free_key` (an int bitmask where bit `r*cols + c` is set iff cell `(r,c)` is free — ~300× smaller than a frozenset and O(1) to hash), so cached entries are pure functions of their inputs and safely reused across every solve call within a worker. Cache caps are **auto-sized to the grid and the memory budget** (see [Memory budget](#memory-budget) below). Because the caches are pure memoization, they are fully disposable: under memory pressure they are cleared and shrunk (forcing recomputation, never a wrong answer).
5. **Optimality.** The goal is checked at each layer; the first match is optimal by construction. Path reconstruction backtracks through parent pointers to produce a command sequence.

Commands: `U` (up), `D` (down), `L` (left), `R` (right), `S` (switch control).

## Usage

### Run test cases

[`run_tests.py`](run_tests.py) solves each test case, validates the resulting path, and writes the solved sequence to `plots/tests/<name>/`. With no arguments it runs every test case; pass a substring to filter.

```bash
python run_tests.py                       # run every test case
python run_tests.py 3x3                    # only tests whose name contains "3x3"
python run_tests.py 4x4_robot_holes --simplified --keep-relative-robot-size
```

| Flag | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `name` (positional) | all | Substring filter — run only tests whose name contains it |
| `--simplified` | off | After solving, also run the wall-simplification pass (below). Without it, behaviour is unchanged: solve + plot only |
| `--keep-all-orange` | (default mode) | Simplify: keep every *touched* wall; remove only never-touched walls + crop |
| `--keep-relative-robot-size` | — | Simplify: keep contact peaks plus enough cells that no gap exceeds n−1 (an n×n robot still can't cross) |
| `--keep-peaks` | — | Simplify: keep only the peak-contact cell per face-edge |
| `--alternate` | — | Simplify: remove every other touched wall |

The four simplify modes are mutually exclusive and only take effect together with `--simplified`.

**The simplification pass** removes walls that aren't load-bearing and crops all-wall borders, then **re-solves to verify the minimum switch count is unchanged.** A wall the robots never touch ("black") is always removed; touched ("orange") walls are thinned according to the chosen mode. Results — a before/after image, a solved sequence, and `simplification.txt` — land in `plots/tests/<name>/simplified/`. The report reads **PRESERVED** if the switch count held, or **FAILED** if a removed wall turned out to be load-bearing.

### Run demos

```bash
python demo_solver.py
python demo_validator.py
```

### Find the hardest workspace

[`find_hardest_workspace.py`](find_hardest_workspace.py) is a parallel candidate generator that searches grid + obstacle configurations to find the workspace requiring the most control switches. It uses a priority queue with enqueue-time depth filtering, a sound symmetric-connectivity pre-check, multiprocessing across cores, and a kill-switch for graceful early termination.

```bash
python find_hardest_workspace.py --rows 3 --cols 3 --n 1 --depth 4
```

Flags:

| Flag | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `--rows`, `--cols` | `3`, `3` | Grid dimensions |
| `--n` | `1` | Robot edge length (n×n) |
| `--depth` | `4` | Max obstacles to dig |
| `--processes` | auto | Worker count for the multiprocessing pool |
| `--strategy` | `single` | `single` digs one cell at a time; `strip` digs n-cell strips |
| `--touching` | `edge` | `edge` = full-edge-adjacent robot pairs only; `all` = also corner / partial-offset pairs |
| `--central-only` | off | Only run the most-central representative per adjacency orientation (1–2 placements) — sound because any placement's workspaces can be replicated from a central one |
| `--cache-mb` | `150` | Per-worker memory budget for the bfs flood caches. Cap counts auto-scale with grid area so memory stays near this target. Raise for very large grids (e.g. `500` for 30×30, `1000+` for 100×100) if you have the RAM, or lower `--processes` to give each worker more headroom. |
| `--quiet` | off | Suppress per-iteration progress output |

Outputs land in `plots/hardest/run_<R>x<C>_n<N>/` (proof images plus a `summary.txt`).

At startup each run prints its auto-sized caps, e.g.:
```
Cache sizing (budget=150 MB/worker): parent_map=3400  usable=8400  valid_pos=4200
```

At the end of each run the aggregated cache usage is printed (and appended to `summary.txt`):
```
CACHE USAGE (aggregated across all placements)
  usable      peak_size=.../8400 (...) hits=... hit_rate=...  evictions=...
  parent_map  peak_size=.../3400 (...) hits=... hit_rate=...  evictions=...
```
If any line ends with `HIT LIMIT`, that cache had evictions — raise `--cache-mb` or tune the per-cache caps in [`src/bfs.py`](src/bfs.py).

### Reusable building blocks

Several pieces are factored into `src/` so other tools can import them:

- [`src/canonical.py`](src/canonical.py) — touching-placement enumeration (`all_touching_placements` covers full-edge, partial-edge, and corner contacts; `all_adjacent_placements` is full-edge only), `pick_central_placements`, and the **`Canonicalizer`** class. `Canonicalizer(rows, cols, n)` turns a workspace (free cells + the two robot positions) into one key that is identical under D4 rotation/flip/mirror and the A↔B label swap; use `.dedup_placements(...)` or `.unique_touching(...)` to collapse symmetric duplicates.
- [`src/frontier.py`](src/frontier.py) — `initial_frontier` / `extend_frontier` for growing or digging a free region cell by cell.
- [`src/simplify.py`](src/simplify.py) — `run_simplification(...)`, the wall-removal pass behind `run_tests.py --simplified`.
- [`src/workspace.py`](src/workspace.py) — `Workspace.from_free_cells(...)` builds a wall-filled grid with only the given cells carved free; `Workspace.valid_block_positions` / `Workspace.extend_valid` answer n×n placement queries over a free-cell set.

## Test Cases

## Code Knowledge Graph (optional)

The `scripts/graphify/` folder contains a small wrapper around [graphify](https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify) that builds a queryable knowledge graph of this codebase — useful for navigating the architecture or handing a structured map of the code to other AI models.

```bash
pip install graphifyy
python scripts/graphify/build_graph.py . --exclude plots
```

Outputs land in `graphify-out/`:

- `graph.json` — raw graph data (pass this to ChatGPT, Cursor, Codex, etc.)
- `GRAPH_REPORT.md` — audit report with god nodes, surprising connections, and suggested questions
- `graph.html` — interactive visualization, open in any browser

To list community contents (helps when naming them):

```bash
python scripts/graphify/list_communities.py
```

The graph is **rebuilt automatically on every commit** that touches a `.py` file, via the `graphify-build` pre-commit hook. You don't need to run `build_graph.py` manually unless you want to refresh between commits.

For richer extraction that also reads docs and images via AI subagents, see the [graphify project](https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify) for the list of supported environments. Local usage details are in [`scripts/graphify/README.md`](scripts/graphify/README.md).
